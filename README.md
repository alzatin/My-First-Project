 You can use molecules to organize the different parts of your project. For this small table project I'll create 3 molecules: 
- Legs
- Top

Inputs are variables which can help you and others modify your design. Possible inputs for a table would be table height, wood thickness, leg width.

Import svg files to use in your project. 

Molecules can be nested so you can make as many levels of molecules as you'd like. 
On the top left of the screen you can see which molecule you're inside of.

Connect your final assembly to the output. This will create a thumbnail and create a final atom that others will be able to see and fork on run mode. 
It will also let you see your whole design as a wireframe while you're inside other atoms.
